# Part 1 (Bugs):

#### A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown):
```
@Test
  public void testReverse(){
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3,4};
    int[] expected = {4,3,2,1};

    assertArrayEquals(expected, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

#### An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown):

```
@Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

#### The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above):

#### The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown):

#### Before:
```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

#### After:
```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

It looks like the values in the new reversed array are not being updated correctly. In order to fix this issue, we should update the newArray and not the original. And also return the newArray
